# rbatools

This tool serves as an interface to resource-allocation modelling with the RBA-method (https://rba.inrae.fr).
It includes methods to solve, manipulate and analyse RBA-models and to export model information and simulation results into various formats.

A requirement for the usage of this tool, is to install the rba library from this repository:
https://github.com/SysBioInra/RBApy

RBA models can be obtained from the repository https://github.com/SysBioInra/Bacterial-RBA-models

Information on RBA can be found at https://rba.inrae.fr and on rbatools at https://rba.inrae.fr/rbatools
